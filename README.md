 <h3>Social Blog With Python - Django<h3>

  <p>
    <i>
      I created this application with Python - Django. Everything belongs to me. (Backend and Fronted everything).
      This project is a social blog. People can share their articles, They can make comments, And they can add their todos.
      Their todos are private. Todos can be seen only by people who created them. Articles can be private or public. People can comment to articles and comments.
      This application is a product of my hobby and it was not created for any money...
